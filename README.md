# Learning React Native!

## HelloWorld
HelloWorld is an example react native application based on the managed/expo
workflow. Currently it does two things:

* has some buttons you can tap to increment a counter
* GETs some todo items from an api (thank you jsonplaceholder!) and sticks
    them in a list with some formatting.

## jwt_client
The JWT client follows the tutorial
[here](https://medium.com/@njwest/building-a-react-native-jwt-client-efacf78b9364)
to attempt to connect to a very basic ASP.NET backend with Identity built
in, get JWT tokens, and send authenticated GET requests.
