# Learning React Native!

## HelloWorld
HelloWorld is an example react native application based on the managed/expo
workflow. Currently it does a small subset of what we'd want a "real" app
to do:

* Has a basic navigation structure
* Allows you to take photos and displays them in "Submit report"
* Aaaaand, that's it so far! Stay tuned.


## jwt_client
The JWT client follows the tutorial
[here](https://medium.com/@njwest/building-a-react-native-jwt-client-efacf78b9364)
to attempt to connect to a very basic ASP.NET backend with Identity built
in, get JWT tokens, and send authenticated GET requests.
