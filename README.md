# Learning React Native!

HelloWorld is an example react native application based on the managed/expo
workflow. Currently it does two things:

* has some buttons you can tap to increment a counter
* GETs some todo items from an api (thank you jsonplaceholder!) and sticks
    them in a list with some formatting.
